# London Transport Network Visualizations

This document describes the network visualizations generated by `visualize_transport_networks.py` to analyze London's transport network structure and evolution.

## ðŸ“Š Generated Visualizations

All visualizations are saved in `../Plots/network_visualizations/` and include:

### 1. Snapshot Graph
**File:** `snapshot_numbat_2019_total.png`
- **Purpose:** Shows the complete transport network structure for a representative pre-COVID year
- **Features:**
  - **Node Size:** Proportional to internal borough travel (self-loop weights)
  - **Edge Thickness/Color:** Based on passenger flow volume (red = high, light = low)
  - **Layout:** Force-directed (Fruchterman-Reingold) showing spatial clustering
  - **Insights:** Reveals which boroughs are major activity centers and key flow corridors

### 2. Before/After Comparison
**File:** `before_after_2019_vs_2022.png`
- **Purpose:** Visualizes the impact of COVID-19 on transport patterns
- **Comparison:** 2019 (Pre-COVID) vs 2022 (Post-COVID)
- **Features:**
  - Side-by-side network layouts for easy comparison
  - Shows changes in node sizes (internal activity) and edge weights (flows)
  - Reveals which boroughs and corridors were most affected by the pandemic

### 3. Heatmaps
**Files:** 
- `heatmap_numbat_2019_total.png` (Pre-COVID)
- `heatmap_numbat_2022_total.png` (Post-COVID)

- **Purpose:** Scientific visualization of the complete adjacency matrix
- **Features:**
  - **X-axis:** Destination boroughs
  - **Y-axis:** Origin boroughs
  - **Color Intensity:** Passenger flow volume (red = high, white = low)
  - **Diagonal:** Self-loops showing internal borough travel
  - **Insights:** Clear patterns of flow concentration and spatial relationships

### 4. Statistical Summaries
**Files:**
- `stats_numbat_2019_total.png` (Pre-COVID)
- `stats_numbat_2022_total.png` (Post-COVID)

- **Purpose:** Comprehensive statistical analysis of network properties
- **Features:**
  - **Top 10 Boroughs:** By internal travel volume
  - **Flow Distribution:** Histogram of edge weights (log scale)
  - **Network Statistics:** Summary metrics (nodes, edges, total flow, etc.)
  - **Connectivity Distribution:** Degree distribution of boroughs

### 5. RODS vs NUMBAT Comparison
**File:** `rods_vs_numbat_2015_vs_2019.png`
- **Purpose:** Compares survey-based (RODS) vs smartcard-based (NUMBAT) data
- **Comparison:** RODS 2015 vs NUMBAT 2019
- **Insights:** Shows differences in data coverage and methodology

### 6. AM Peak Comparison
**File:** `am_peak_comparison_2015_vs_2021.png`
- **Purpose:** Compares morning peak commuting patterns
- **Comparison:** RODS 2015 AM Peak vs NUMBAT 2021 AM Peak
- **Insights:** Shows evolution of peak-hour travel patterns and data quality improvements

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Insights to Look For

### Network Structure
- **Central Hubs:** Westminster, Camden, and City of London typically show large nodes
- **Flow Corridors:** Thick edges reveal major transport corridors
- **Spatial Clustering:** Force-directed layout shows geographic proximity effects

### Temporal Changes
- **COVID Impact:** 2022 networks show reduced overall flows and changed patterns
- **Peak vs Off-Peak:** AM peak shows concentrated flows to central London
- **Data Evolution:** NUMBAT shows more comprehensive coverage than RODS

### Borough Characteristics
- **Internal Activity:** Large nodes indicate boroughs with high internal travel
- **Connectivity:** Degree distribution shows which boroughs are most connected
- **Flow Patterns:** Heatmaps reveal origin-destination preferences

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

### Visualization Parameters
- **Node Sizing:** Logarithmic scaling of self-loop weights
- **Edge Coloring:** Red color map with intensity based on flow volume
- **Layout Algorithm:** Fruchterman-Reingold force-directed layout
- **Resolution:** 300 DPI for publication quality

### Data Sources
- **RODS:** Rolling Origin-Destination Survey (2000-2017)
- **NUMBAT:** Network Usage Model (2017-2023)
- **Time Periods:** Various time bands and day types
- **Aggregation:** Station-to-borough level

### Color Schemes
- **Nodes:** Light blue for boroughs
- **Edges:** Red gradient (light = low flow, dark = high flow)
- **Heatmaps:** Reds color map for flow intensity

## ðŸ“ˆ Usage in Research

These visualizations support:
1. **Network Analysis:** Understanding London's transport topology
2. **Temporal Analysis:** Tracking changes over time
3. **Spatial Analysis:** Identifying geographic patterns
4. **Policy Impact:** Assessing infrastructure and policy effects
5. **Methodology Comparison:** Evaluating different data sources

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

The visualizations can be enhanced by:
- Adding geographic coordinates for more realistic layouts
- Including transport line information
- Creating animated visualizations showing temporal evolution
- Adding statistical significance testing for changes
- Incorporating external factors (population, employment, etc.)
