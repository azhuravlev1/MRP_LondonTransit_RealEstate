PANEL REGRESSION RESULTS INTERPRETATION
============================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------
This analysis examines the relationship between London's transit network centrality
and housing prices from 2001 to 2023, using
panel regression with fixed effects to control for borough-specific and time-specific factors.

KEY FINDINGS
---------------
• 1 out of 4 centrality measures show
  statistically significant effects on housing prices (p < 0.05)

• Largest effect: Passenger Arrivals (t-1)
  - Coefficient: 0.0128
  - Effect size: 1.29% change in house prices
  - Significance: p = 0.0000

DETAILED RESULTS
------------------
Passenger Arrivals (t-1):
  • Coefficient: 0.0128 (SE: 0.0029)
  • Effect size: 1.29% change in house prices
  • Significance: p = 0.0000 (***)
  • Interpretation: A one standard deviation increase in Passenger Arrivals
    is associated with a 1.29% change in house prices

Betweenness Centrality (t-1):
  • Coefficient: -0.0069 (SE: 0.0035)
  • Effect size: -0.68% change in house prices
  • Significance: p = 0.0522 (*)
  • Interpretation: A one standard deviation increase in Betweenness Centrality
    is associated with a -0.68% change in house prices

Closeness Centrality (t-1):
  • Coefficient: 0.0022 (SE: 0.0024)
  • Effect size: 0.22% change in house prices
  • Significance: p = 0.3544 (not significant)
  • Interpretation: A one standard deviation increase in Closeness Centrality
    is associated with a 0.22% change in house prices

Eigenvector Centrality (t-1):
  • Coefficient: -0.0067 (SE: 0.0140)
  • Effect size: -0.67% change in house prices
  • Significance: p = 0.6318 (not significant)
  • Interpretation: A one standard deviation increase in Eigenvector Centrality
    is associated with a -0.67% change in house prices

POLICY IMPLICATIONS
--------------------
• Transit accessibility is significantly capitalized into London housing prices
• Network centrality measures provide valuable indicators of locational advantage
• Infrastructure investments that improve network connectivity may have
  measurable impacts on property values
• The relationship varies across different types of centrality, suggesting
  nuanced effects of different aspects of transit accessibility

METHODOLOGICAL NOTES
----------------------
• Panel regression with fixed effects controls for unobserved borough-specific
  and time-specific factors
• Lagged variables (t-1) are used to establish temporal precedence
• Standardized coefficients allow comparison of effect sizes across measures
• Clustered standard errors account for potential correlation within boroughs
